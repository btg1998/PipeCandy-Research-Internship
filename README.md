Designed Heuristic Algorithms using ML for various E-Commerce Platforms 

to efficiently automate the process of scraping for Product URLs 

& also generating a Sitemap. All code was reviewed, perfected, and pushed to production.

Abstract of the Research Internship :

• Worked on coming up with Heuristic Algorithms to efficiently automate the
process of scraping the E-Commerce Web Pages for Product Page URLs and in
the process generating a Sitemap for E-Commerce Sites.

• By applying ML Models on Product URLs and Non Product URLs of various
E-Commere Sites, a Bag of Words were obtained.

• Using the above Key-Words, Heuristic Algorithms for various
E-Commerce Platforms were designed to efficiently scrape the Web Pages.

• All code was reviewed, perfected, and pushed to production.
